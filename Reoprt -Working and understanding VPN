Summary
VeePN browser extension on Edge offers easy setup, encrypted traffic, and location masking.

It's suitable for browsing privately, bypassing basic geo-restrictions, and preventing tracking.

However, speed may drop slightly, and advanced features like Kill Switch or full device encryption are only available in the paid version.

It's best for light-to-medium privacy needs (not deep anonymity like Tor).
